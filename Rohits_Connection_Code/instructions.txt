How to use the code in \Rohits_Connection_Code

1. Compile the .java files with:

	$ javac  .\jdbcpostgreSQL.java

	This will create .class files. The .class files are neccessary to run the program.
	
2. Execute the compiled code with:

	$ java -cp ".;postgresql-42.2.8.jar" jdbcpostgreSQL


Do these steps^ through a command-line interface. IDK how to do it via netbeans yet

Queries are made starting on line 22 of jdbcpostgreSQL.java. It should be pretty self explanatory how they work. 
the goal is to integrate the code in this directory into the GUI.

I have my credentials included in dbSetup.java. You can use your own if you want.
