How to use the code in \Rohits_Connection_Code

1. Compile the .java files with

	$ javac  .\jdbcpostgreSQL.java

2. Run the code with 

	$ java -cp ".;postgresql-42.2.8.jar" jdbcpostgreSQL

the goal is to integrate the code in this directory into the GUI.

I have my credentials included in dbSetup.java. You can use your own if you want.
